# Iris Flower Type Prediction with Streamlit

# Description:
This repository contains a Streamlit application for predicting the types of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris flower dataset is a classic machine learning dataset that is commonly used for introductory classification tasks.

The Streamlit application provides an interactive interface where users can input the measurements of a new Iris flower, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Based on these inputs, the application utilizes a trained machine learning model to predict the type of Iris flower.

# Key Features:

- Interactive User Interface: The Streamlit application offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to input the measurements of an Iris flower and obtain predictions instantly.
- Machine Learning Model: The application employs a pre-trained machine learning model, which has been trained on the famous Iris flower dataset, to make accurate -predictions based on the input features.
- Real-Time Predictions: Users can see the predicted Iris flower type along with probability scores in real time, providing immediate feedback on the classification outcome.
- Data Visualization: The application also includes visualizations such as scatter plots and histograms, enabling users to explore the Iris flower dataset and gain insights into the relationships between different features.
